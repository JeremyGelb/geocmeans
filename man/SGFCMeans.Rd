\usage{
SGFCMeans(
  data,
  nblistw,
  k,
  m,
  alpha,
  beta,
  lag_method = "mean",
  maxiter = 500,
  tol = 0.01,
  standardize = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  init = "random",
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe with only numerical variable}

\item{nblistw}{A list.w object describing the neighbours typically produced
by the spdep package}

\item{k}{An integer describing the number of cluster to find}

\item{m}{A float for the fuzziness degree}

\item{alpha}{A float representing the weight of the space in the analysis (0
is a typical fuzzy-c-mean algorithm, 1 is balanced between the two
dimensions, 2 is twice the weight for space)}

\item{beta}{A float for the beta parameter (control speed convergence and classification crispness)}

\item{lag_method}{A string indicating if a classical lag must be used
("mean") or if a weighted median must be used ("median")}

\item{maxiter}{An integer for the maximum number of iteration}

\item{tol}{The tolerance criterion used in the evaluateMatrices function for
convergence assessment}

\item{standardize}{A boolean to specify if the variable must be centered and
reduced (default = True)}

\item{verbose}{A boolean to specify if the progress bar should be displayed}

\item{init}{A string indicating how the initial centers must be selected. "random"
indicates that random observations are used as centers. "kpp" use a distance based method
resulting in more dispersed centers at the beginning. Both of them are heuristic.}

\item{seed}{An integer used for random number generation. It ensures that the
start centers will be the same if the same integer is selected.}
}
\value{
A named list with
\itemize{
        \item Centers: a dataframe describing the final centers of the groups
        \item Belongings: the final membership matrix
        \item Groups: a vector with the names of the most likely group for each observation
        \item Data: the dataset used to perform the clustering (might be standardized)
}

\description{
spatial version of the generalized c-mean algorithm (SGFCMeans)
}
\details{
The implementation is based on the following article : \doi{10.1016/j.dsp.2012.09.016}.\cr

the matrix of belonging (u) is calculated as follow \cr
\deqn{u_{ik} = \frac{(||x_{k} - v{_i}||^2 -b_k + \alpha||\bar{x_{k}} - v{_i}||^2)^{(-1/(m-1))}}{\sum_{j=1}^c(||x_{k} - v{_j}||^2 -b_k + \alpha||\bar{x_{k}} - v{_j}||^2)^{(-1/(m-1))}}}

the centers of the groups are updated with the following formula
\deqn{v_{i} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^N u_{ik}^m(x_{k} + \alpha\bar{x_{k}})}{(1 + \alpha)\sum_{k=1}^N u_{ik}^m}}

with
\itemize{
\item vi the center of the group vi
\item xk the data point k
\item xk_bar the spatially lagged data point k
\deqn{b_k = \beta \times min(||x_{k} - v||)}
}
